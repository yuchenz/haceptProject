us and india to conduct first joint military exercise in mid-may in 4 decades
( afp , new delhi ) the united states and india will conduct their first joint military exercise in 39 years to mark a milestone in the cooperation between the two largest democracies in the world .
the ministry of national defense said that in mid-may , an elite brigade of indian paratroopers will conduct a joint military exercise with the special forces of the us pacific command near the renowned taj mahal .
the air forces from the two nations will provide support .
the ministry of national defense said it will be the first of the many military exercises to be conducted by the two nations .
the relations between the united states and india were strained during the cold war era . however , the situation has been dramatically improved since the sept. 11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c .
apart from patrolling the sea with the us navy in the strait of malacca between indonesia and malaysia so as to prevent any acts of piracy , india in recent years has also conducted joint military exercises with britain , france and japan .
a spokesman from the ministry of national defense of india said : " the upcoming exercise aims at further enhancing the military cooperation between india and the united states . "
the last time india conducted a joint military exercise with the united states was a year after a brief border war between india and china in 1962 .
since last july , about 50 us policy makers have visited india while about an equal number of people from india , including prime minister vajpayee and his national security team , paid visits to washington d.c .
after the sept. 11 terrorist attacks , and the attack on the national parliament in new delhi last december that led to military tensions between india and pakistan , there have been increased contacts between the united states and india .
the diplomat said that the national defense policy makers in the united states and india decided on the mid-may military exercise in february partly because they also wanted to ease new delhi 's discomfort over the strengthening relationship between the united states and pakistan .

shuttleworth is the second paying space tourist in history after the american citizen tito .
both he and tito paid 20 million us dollars for their chance of space travel .
shuttleworth boarded a russian spacecraft on april 25 to enter space where he stayed for 10 days to conduct a series of medical and biological science experiments .
returning together with shuttleworth to earth are the russian spacecraft commander gidzenko and the italian engineer vittori who entered space with him .

us government not impressed by castro 's goodwill stance to carter
( afp , washington ) the us president bush 's administration is not impressed by the goodwill stance the cuban president castro has extended to former us president carter who is making a landmark visit to the communist island nation cuba .
castro expressed his willingness to allow carter to meet freely with dissidents and visit all areas , including those labs that washington has alleged are manufacturing key biological weapon components .
the white house and the state department said these proposals are meaningless .
the us state department spokeswoman cassel said : " president carter is visiting cuba as a private citizen . he has not been sent there to inspect possible facilities of chemical or biological weapons . "
her brief remark seems to echo the response of other commentators who pointed out that neither carter nor the other members of his delegation have any science background necessary for a proper inspection of the labs .
carter insisted that there was no mention of the us concern over cuba 's plan for biological weapons while he was briefed by the government officials , but the us secretary of state powell indicated he did not believe this .
powell told abc network : " i do n't know what briefing president carter was given . i am certain that we have no reservation
about our belief that cuba possesses the research capabilities for biological warfare . "
napster ceo hilbers resigns
( afp , san francisco ) napster , the once all-popular company for free music downloading , said that its chief executive hilbers has resigned , effective immediately .
it is still unknown at present who will be hilbers ' replacement .
napster 's music website has remained closed as of today ever since the court ruled last year that its service had given rise to wide-spread copying .
after napster 's music website was shut down , many other websites have taken its place .
the redwood city , california-based napster stated : " we deeply regret that we have n't got a solution to funding yet that would enable napster to launch a service to benefit artists and website users . "
it went on to say : " we will take measures in the coming week to further cut expenses . "
hilbers , once an executive officer of the german media giant bertelsmann , took the position of napster ceo at a time when bertelsmann started to help the struggling napster to continue its operation within the framework of the court ruling .
oecd ministers examine outlook of world economy in paris
( afp , paris ) senior ministers from the major industrial nations in the world met in paris on the 15th for a 2-day meeting . they will examine the future of a promising economy as well as confront the looming division caused by the trade dispute between the united states and europe .
representatives from the 30 member nations of the organization for economic cooperation and development will also concern themselves with the conflict arising from the efforts of rich and poor nations as they abridge the gap between them .
however , the discussion on macroeconomics may be eclipsed by the escalating trade friction between the united states and the european union .
leaders from the european nations expressed their indignation on a bill signed by president bush on the 13th that will allow the government to increase its subsidies to the us farmers by 70% over the next decade .
the eu officials think the bill violates the promise the united states made at the wto ministerial conference held in doha , capital of qatar , last november on terminating its farm export subsidies .
at the forum prior to the opening ceremony of the ministerial meeting , belgian prime minister verhofstadt said : " it is hypocritical to talk with eloquence about the market liberalization yet fail to implement it . "
mid-term election may slow down us efforts to promote free trade
( afp , washington ) economists and analysts say that many of the additional trade barriers imposed to woo voters in all constituencies in the mid-term election may slow down the ever ongoing us efforts to promote global free trade .
economist schott from the institute for international economics , a washington think tank , said : " us president bush is determined to put the political goal above that of promoting a sound us economy . "
the bush administration , said he , succumbing to pressures from the steel industry and its labor union , levies a tariff of as high as 30% on certain steel products from a number of major suppliers , including the eu , russia , japan and brazil .
in addition , bush also imposes an anti-dumping tariff of 27% on a certain kind of lumber from canada to be used as building material on the ground that the canadian government 's export subsidies on the lumber have constituted dumping .
schott said , what is more aggravating is that in the recently promulgated " farm bill , " the us federal government has increased subsidies on certain farm products by nearly 80% , grossly violating the promise the united states made in the trade negotiations held last november in doha , capital of qatar .
at doha conference , the united states insisted on the liberalization of farm trade so as to help facilitate the access of farm products of poor nations into the markets of rich nations .
correspondingly , under the free trade , developed nations will also find it easier to provide poor nations with their products and services .
the damage of this us farm bill to the free trade , said schott , has far surpassed the damage brought about by the measure of imposing tariffs on steel imports .
us government officials defend government 's handling of warnings of terrorist attacks
( afp , washington ) senior us officials scrambled to defend the government 's handling of the warnings prior to the sept. 11 terrorist attacks , the reports alleged , that included the warning that terrorists under osama bin laden might hijack us commercial airlines .
secretary of defense rumsfeld insisted in nbc 's today show that president bush " did what he should , namely , to go all out to pursue the global terrorist organizations and do everything in his power to deal with the nations that harbor these terrorists . "
he said that terrorists " may attack at any time and by any means available . it would be practically impossible to protect all locations at all times . "
us vice president cheney , on the other hand , warned the democrats last night " to be extra cautious and not to seek political interests by making incendiary remarks such as saying the white house had received advance information and could have prevented the bloody sept. 11 attacks . "
after the white house admitted on the night of the 15th that bush had received the warning prior to the sept. 11 terrorist attacks that terrorists might hijack us commercial airplanes , the government came under fire .
british airways posts first annual loss in 15 years
( afp , london ) as reported by british airways , although the amount of loss is smaller than expected , british airways has posted its first annual loss since its privatization 15 years ago .
in the previous fiscal year that ended at the end of march , british airways ' pre-tax loss is 200 million ( 320 million euros or 290 million us dollars ) against a restated profit of 150 million the preceding year .
in the fourth quarter alone , british airways lost 85 million , compared with a loss of 65 million a year ago .
the former state-owned british airways blamed the poor performance on the sept. 11 terrorist attacks of last year , a global economic slowdown , and the foot-and-mouth disease which kept foreign tourists away from britain .
the annual dividend , said british airways , was thus scrapped .
eddington , the airline 's chief executive , said : " the airline market is expected to remain weak but the quick and decisive actions we have taken have shown we are determined to return the business to acceptable levels of profitability . "
however , the result still beat the market expectation that british airways would lose even more .
in the early trading session at the stock market , the ba shares rose 2.6% to 241.75 pence .
this price was 8% down from the price shortly before the september 11 attacks ; yet compared with the highest price of 760 pence in may 1997 , it was down by almost 70% .

( afp , washington ) us president bush said that only if cuba holds elections " that can be proved to be free and fair " and promotes the reform in the economic system will the united states lift the 41-year-old embargo against cuba .
bush said in a speech at the white house : " only till then will i work with the us congress to remove the embargo on the trade and travel between the united states and cuba . "
he said : " trade with cuba will only help castro . "
former us president jimmy carter went to cuba for a week 's visit and called for the united states to lift the embargo in this only communist country in the americas .
merely 48 hours after he returned to the united states , bush made this most recent speech of his on cuba .
bush proposed in his speech to step up the humanitarian assistance to cuba and reach agreements directly with the cuban people through non-governmental agencies .
he also indicated that the united states will hold negotiations with cuba on resuming direct mail service between the two countries .
the issue has so far been consistently rejected by the cuban government .

( afp , moscow ) us president bush arrived in moscow today to hold a historic summit on new arms reduction measures and on shaping a 21st-century partnership between the two nations who were once bitter foes .
while moscow is preparing in a grand style for the first visit from president bush , the entire russian capital has stepped up security . one newspaper even cautions the muscovites to watch for the us secret service snipers .

japanese sporting goods firm bankrupt due to poor sales of world cup merchandise
( afp , tokyo ) a former employee said while the world cup fever continues to rage through japan , a small japanese sporting goods firm has been forced onto the path to bankruptcy for owing the huge license fee for manufacturing the world cup goods .
crix yasuda , a firm located in tokyo , applied to the court for bankruptcy protection on may 8 due to poor sales of the 20 items of its promoted merchandise featuring a world cup mascot logo , including bags and whistles .
the former company employee , who declined to be named , said : " our company has gone bankrupt as piles of the world cup mascot goods sit in our warehouse . we could not pay the license fee of 50 million yen ( 400,000 us dollars ) to fifa . "
the employee said : " we entrusted a chinese company to manufacture the goods in china and started to sell the merchandise in japan in may last year .
now the world cup fever is raging , but our company went bankrupt even before the fever arrived . "
established in 1932 , crix yasuda marketed soccer gear , including boots and kit . it employed a total of 12 employees .
a figure for the company 's liabilities was not immediately available .

pakistan , having indicated it would conduct a series of missile tests from the 25th to the 28th , has ignored the international appeal for restraints and test-fired two types of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads - - a " ghauri " medium-range missile capable of penetrating india and a newly-developed " ghaznavi " short-range missile .
international leaders led by us president bush have shown concerns over the missile tests . bush , however , indicated he is more concerned that " musharraf demonstrates some results ( in the global war on terrorism ) . "
speaking about musharraf 's prevention of the cross-border incursion into india-controlled kashmir , bush said : " he must show his efforts . "
the cross-border incursion into indian-administered kashmir by pakistani radicals has already intensified the dispute between these two nuclear powers , resulting in a dangerous border stand-off .
in order to prevent the conflict from breaking out between these two hostile south asian nations , the international community is intensifying its diplomatic moves . deputy russian foreign minister saltanov is scheduled to arrive on a peace mission here today .
saltanov will discuss russian president putin 's proposal .
besides the meeting to be held at alma ata , capital of kazakhstan , from june 3 through june 5 , putin indicated he is willing to arrange a face-to-face meeting between pakistani and indian leaders .

interior ministers of european nations met for discussion on establishment of eu border police force
( afp , rome ) interior ministers from the 15 eu nations and other 13 european nations met on the eve of summit of all european nations to discuss the establishment of a eu border police force to tackle the issue of illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister scajola said interior ministers of these eu nations and the other 13 eu-candidate nations will focus their discussion on the finding of a study regarding the establishment of a common police force to guard the eu exterior border .
scajola said the top priority of this police force will be to guard all the airports . these airports , said he , are exactly the main passages through which most of illegal immigrants enter the eu territory .
in an interview with italian news agency , he said : " according to our analysis , the airports are obviously the main passages to enter the territory and are therefore the places at the highest risk . "
scajola said it is of top priority to coordinate their various different police forces if the nations want to ensure the security of the eu .
he said : " our final goal is not necessarily to establish a single european police force but rather to facilitate an exchange of data and information among ourselves while standardizing police training . "
experts gathering here pointed out that there are still difficulties for europe to establish a common border police force , but the main reason lies in the political and legal barriers that exist between the eu nations on one hand and the eu-candidate nations on the other .
the interior ministers attending the 4-hour conference today will discuss the 15 short , medium and long-term moves in hopes of reinforcing europe 's porous border , including international airports .
us assesses worst consequence of india-pakistan nuclear war could be loss of millions of lives
( afp , washington ) citing the confidential assessment report from the pentagon , a us defense official pointed out that if a nuclear war broke out between india and pakistan , the worst scenario would be the loss of lives ranging from 9 million to 12 million . that figure could merely be the instant death toll resulting from the nuclear war , not including the deaths from diseases , starvation and polluted water supplies that accompanied the war .
recently , the relations between india and pakistan in south asia have been growing more and more tense over the disputed kashmir . as a result , the us defense intelligence updated this classified assessment report last week .
the official , who declined to be named , said that under the worst circumstances , in a short period of time " the death toll could range from 9 ( million ) to 12 million , and another 2 ( million ) to 6 million could be injured . "
he said : " in the long run , all those things such as starvation , polluted water supplies and birth defects could happen . "
the us official said the likelihood of the above scenario is based on the assumption that the number of nuclear weapons on each side matches the number of their targets while all weapons are successfully launched , resulting in surface explosions and dispersion of radioactive dust clouds .

us fbi agents take actions against underwater terrorism
( afp , miami ) us fbi agents have taken underwater anti-terrorist actions and sought the help from the diving industry in their detection of possible terrorist activities so as to " develop an offensive scuba diving capability . "
the fbi has begun a nationwide canvass of shops of scuba diving gear , requesting them to report any suspicious students or customers .

reynolds tobacco company fined 20 million us dollars for illegal ads
( afp , san diego , california ) california officials said that reynolds , the no. 2 us tobacco company , has been fined 20 million us dollars by a san diego judge for running cigarette ads in magazines in an illegal attempt to lure youths aged from 12 to 17 into smoking .
the ruling judge prager said under the terms of the 1998 agreement signed by the 46 us states , tobacco companies are barred from running cigarette ads in popular teenager magazines and from targeting youths .
some time earlier , three tobacco companies , the makers of camel , winston and salem , violated the terms ; yet reynolds still followed suit and did not scale down in any way the cigarette ad campaign targeting the youths .
the california 's attorney general lockyer served as the prosecutor in this case . after three weeks of trial , the ruling judge ordered reynolds to pay a fine of 20 million us dollars in addition to all attorney and litigation fees .
in the future , reynolds must also take specific measures to effectively comply with the 1998 agreement .
the 1998 master settlement agreement bans running cigarette ads on bulletins and buses as well as limits the size of other cigarette ad bulletins . in addition , it restricts the giant cigarette makers from paying the media to promote their products or sponsoring youth sports games .
lockyer said while other tobacco companies have long agreed not to advertise in magazines with over 15% readership of youth aged from 12 to 17 , reynolds has been reluctant to do so .
it was only a month ago that a los angeles court fined reynolds 14.8 million us dollars for handing out free cigarettes worth over 100,000 us dollars at events in which children also participated .
us labor department report on employment rate shows economy is recovering but at a slow pace
( afp , washington ) according to a us government report , there are signs that the us job market is recovering , although the pace of recovery is extremely slow , indicating the overall us economy is still struggling out of recession .
labor department said , in may there was an increase of about 41,000 job opportunities in the united states , while the unemployment rate dropped by 0.2% to 5.8% .
this is the biggest increase in non-farm job opportunities since february 2001 and is also the second straight month in the increase of employment following 12 consecutive months of steady decrease of employment .
unemployment rate is lower than wall street expected , but the number of newly-created job opportunities is smaller than many expected . according to economists , the newly created job opportunities are not enough to significantly promote the economic growth .
analysts said only a robust increase in job opportunities can lead to consumer spending , which in turn promotes the economic growth .
naroff of naroff economic advisors said the report from the labor department is surely good news , but it is just not good enough .
although there is an increase in job opportunities , the pace of increase is just yet too slow .

( afp , washington ) egyptian president mubarak insisted that the creation of a palestinian state under us pressure will help to achieve peace in the middle east , but us president bush refused to offer a specific timetable for the creation of the palestinian state .

today bush met with israeli prime minister sharon at the white house to hold further talks on the mideast crisis .
bush is trying to finalize the us government 's mideast policy and to lay the foundation for an international peace conference in the coming few months .
mubarak added in an exclusive video-taped interview with fox news : " the united states is the key to the peace process in the middle east . "
the egyptian president thinks that both israeli and palestinian peoples need the united states to help them reach an agreement . if israel and palestine are left alone to solve the problem , " they will accomplish nothing . "
he pointed out that the conflict in northern ireland is the best example of success when the us mediation resulted in an agreement by both parties involved in the conflict .
mubarak also called for bush to pass the message to sharon : " destruction , use of force , slaughter and revenge will never bring about peace . "

the game was temporarily suspended for 20 minutes in the first set because of rain .
the conference 's eleventh-seeded ferrero , who did not seem to be in his best shape in the game , played in a somewhat awkward way . although he tried his hardest to fight back , he had to come to terms with his second place due to his double faults as well as excessive unforced errors and frequently broken serves .

it is the first time for both costa and ferrero to have entered the grand slam . this is also the 12th tournament title costa has won in his career as a professional tennis player .

costa fought his way all through to the tournament final , successively beating the brazilian tennis king kuerten the iron man and corretja , the spaniard player on red clay who won the second place at the french open last year . winning the crown at this french open will move costa ' ranking in the world way up to the 2nd .
this is costa 's 26th try for a grand slam title . when there is a will , there will be a way . he has now finally fulfilled his wish of returning home with his championship trophy . before this , even when he was at his best at the grand slam , he never went beyond the quarterfinals in which he played at the french open respectively in 1995 and 2000 , and the australian open in 1997 .

ruling party in south korea faces huge obstacles after setback in local elections
( afp , seoul ) following the crushing defeat in last week 's local elections and the embezzlement scandals involving the two sons of president kim dae-jung who founded the party , millennium democratic party , the ruling party in south korea , is heading toward a break-up .
the reformists attribute the major setback in elections suffered by the mdp on the 13th to the scandals involving kim dae-jung 's aide and sons . now they hope to establish a new political party .
during this election , the opposition party , grand national party , scored a sweeping victory in major provinces and cities , which is yet another most recent sign that kim dae-jung 's reputation is on the decline .
the result of an opinion poll released today in korean central daily shows that of the 60 mdp members of national assembly interviewed , 42 are in favor of founding a new party to be headed by roh moo-hyun , the party 's presidential candidate .
a senior member of national assembly said : " we must work harder to draw a clear line between the party and the president . "

750 dead or missing in floods in china
( afp , beijing ) floods have devastated large areas in china . according to official statistics , over 750 have been killed or missing . a rescue agency pointed out that many victims live in the poorest areas in the country .
the most recent statistics released by the ministry of civil affairs of china show that 453 have been confirmed dead in the floods in 8 provinces and cities . in the worst-hit shaanxi province , 151 have been confirmed dead .
these figures do not include the additional number of 300 people believed to be missing in shaanxi province . jia zhibang , the province 's acting vice governor , thought they have " little chance of survival . "
such a high death toll even in the early phase of the flood season that lasts from june to september this year has caused people to worry that more people may die in floods this year than in the floods of 1998 that drowned over 4,000 people .
statistics from the ministry of civil affairs indicate that up till now , 57 million people have been affected by the floods ; 800,000 buildings and houses have collapsed ; and more than 2 million hectares of farm land have been inundated .
the ministry disclosed that the floods have devastated a vast area of the country , from shaanxi province in the northwest , through sichuan province and chongqing in the southwest , to fujian province and jiangxi province in the southeast .
a staff member named liu , who works for china foundation for poverty alleviation , said today that although the current death toll by floods is smaller than that of 1998 , the affected area is much larger than in 1998 . in that year , 10 provinces and cities were ravaged by floods , but 19 provinces and cities are hit this year .
he pointed out that another characteristic of this year 's floods is that many affected people are extremely poor and have almost no means to sustain their losses .
liu said : " the poverty-stricken areas are especially hit hard in the first phase of the floods this year . many of those counties and cities are listed as the poorest in the country .
some of the disaster areas are rendered inaccessible as roads have been broken by floods . many people have become homeless ; and still many other flood victims are waiting for food and other relief items . "
umno announces mahathir will step down next year ; abdullah to succeed him
( afp , kuala lumpur ) malaysia 's ruling party umno announced that prime minister mahathir will step down next year and hand over his office to his deputy abdullah .
umno secretary general yaakob said that mahathir , who has stayed in power for 21 years , will resign after the summit of the organization of islamic conference to be held here in october next year .
yaakob said mahathir " has decided to resign from all his positions at umno , barisan nasional coalition and the government . "
on the 22nd , at the conclusion of the umno annual congress , mahathir announced in tears his resignation from umno and his presidency of the ruling nasional coalition to a stunned malaysia .
when the entire country of malaysia was watching the live televised announcement of his resignation , mahathir was quickly hustled off the chairman 's podium by stunned umno party leaders into a secluded room . when abdullah returned to the conference hall , he said mahathir has agreed to stay in office .
however , mahathir himself did n't offer any further public explanation and went on a vacation trip to italy the next day after throwing the whole country into a political turmoil .
beneath the huge portrait of mahathir and in the company of abdullah and other umno leaders , yaakob read at umno headquarters the statement clarifying mahathir 's future .
he said that mahathir will take two months of vacation prior to his final resignation so as to facilitate a smooth transfer of power to abdullah .
after this announcement , abdullah , who serves both as vice prime minister and the vice president of umno , said in this live televised press conference : " ( nasional coalition ) superior council supports 100% ( mahathir 's ) this decision . "

us appellate court rules pledge of allegiance unconstitutional
( afp , san francisco , june 27 ) a us appellate court ruled that the pledge of allegiance that us pupils are required to recite every day before classes start is unconstitutional because it uses the name of god .
the shocking ruling made by the three judges in san francisco is bound to set off strong repercussions from the us public .
the relation between the church and the state has long been a topic of major controversy in the united states .
the judges in the 9th us circuit court of appeals pointed out in the written ruling that the sentence containing " one nation , under god " in the pledge of allegiance demonstrates the government 's support of religious intervention forbidden by the us constitution .
an atheist filed the lawsuit with the circuit court of appeals in san francisco in protest that his daughter has to recite the pledge of allegiance every morning in school .
his appeal case was accepted .
citing a us supreme court judgement , judge goodwin noted in the ruling that schools are not allowed to hold religious prayers at the graduation ceremonies nor can students be compelled to recite the pledge of allegiance .
millions of us pupils aged from 5 to 11 must put their right hands across their chests and recite the pledge of allegiance in front of the us national flag every morning before classes start .
the controversial phrase " under god " was added to the pledge of allegiance in 1954 when eisenhower was in office .
the pledger must pledge allegiance to " the flag of the united states of america , and to the republic for which it stands , one nation under god , with liberty and justice indivisible . "
in the united states , the separation of church and state has always been an issue of controversy . the ban of morning prayers by state schools has already caused strong repercussions in this nation known for its devout religious belief and patriotism .
the ruling , once effective , will impact public schools in the 8 western states , the us guam and northern mariana islands .
the case for sure will go to the us supreme court .
